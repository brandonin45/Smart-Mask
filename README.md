# Smart-Mask
This repo showcases the smart mask the my team and I created during my senior year of college (2021). The mask was built with an arduino nano, LED panel, microphones, speakers, switches and programmed with C++/C. The purpose of this project was to alleviate the missing iteractions that result when communicating with face masks. 

## Functions
 * When the user speaks, the LEDs will display a talking motion
 * Able to switch between happy and sad facial expressions
 * Amplify the users voice for when background nosie is present
 * LED grid and voice amplfication can be both powered on/off seperately
